# Please README Before Reviewing the site
This site was created by student s350289@oslomet.no Isak Midtvedt during the period 25.nov - 5.december.
I Worked alone and did all of the coding, styling and editing myself.

The only outside "help" I have had is in the form of the AI art program mindjourney.
This is important information as ALL the images I have used have been generated by this program.
I have a PAID account and per their contract I am allowed to use the images as my own and they are to be considered my personal private intelectual property.
I have therefore not mentioned in my code or on the images themselves where I got them from.

To showcase that I am aware how to do so;
I would most likely use the ::before or ::after selector to make sure it was on the image itself.
I would then mark the image as such: Author(s) - Last name, initial - use & for multiple authors. (Year). Title - italicised. [Image description]. Site name. Web address

I hope that this is ok and I concurred with different TAs on the matter and they agreed that as long as I own the content per the mindjourney agreement I can
use it like I have with no need to mention it.
