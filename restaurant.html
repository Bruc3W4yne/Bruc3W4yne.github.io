                <p><b>Our restaurant</b> at A Pour l'Effort is the world renowned <em>Dorsia</em>.
                    We use only the finest of ingredients available and we pride ourselves
                    on using as much local food as possible. Our menu is ever-changing and rotates
                    based on seasons. We try to accommodate for every diet and religious belief, but we cant
                    make any guarantees.

                <hr>
                <p><b>We focus on happy wine farmers</b> and agriculture, and therefore our wine list is made up
                    exclusively of wines made according to organic or biodynamic principles. 
                    Working organically and not least biodynamically is a labor-intensive process and can present 
                    many challenges when it comes to pests. It takes around 10 years to convert a vineyard 
                    that has been cultivated conventionally to become biodynamic.
