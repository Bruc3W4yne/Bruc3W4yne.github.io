            <p id="main-text">I tested my site for accesibility in several ways. The first and
                easiest way to test it is to use something along the lines of
                WAVE web accesibility Evaluation Tool. It tells you the most glaring
                errors such as low contrast, heading level skipping, no alt text, broken links and more
                WAVE often picks out any A and AA-level errors which is what
                is most important when it comes to making the web accesible.
                <br>
                <br>
                I Then went on to use NVDA, a screen reader tool ment to help those
                with visual impairment. This is one of the broadest accessibility needs
                to adress so I chose to focus on that to begin with. Using the tool
                I was able to map out what controls worked and what didnt. I was then able
                to know which elements to add the ARIA items to; such as Aria-label and Aria-describedby.
                <br>
                <br>
                Other than these steps I also kept in mind contrast and legibility from the get go.
                Unlike many other things, accessibility is something that one needs to keep in mind
                from the start, as it is often time consuming to change underway and also can lead to
                some conflict around the use of different types of elements so be it buttons or others.
